Some example of jsNode
 1. Online chatting
 2. Upload text.
 3. Upload picture(only PNG format)
 4. Using main.html you can insert data into MongoDB
 5. Node app.js and then Climate.js to start insertion

The case2 and case3 are copied from [http://www.nodebeginner.org/index-zh-cn.html#handling-post-requests](http://www.nodebeginner.org/index-zh-cn.html#handling-post-requests),
which is written quite well and you can gain quite a lot from it.
